-- [1] To begin with the project, you need to create the database first
-- Write the Query below to create a Database
create database vehdb;

-- [2] Now, after creating the database, you need to tell MYSQL which database is to be used.
-- Write the Query below to call your Database
use vehdb;

/*Note:
---> To create the table, refer to the ER diagram and the solution architecture.Â 
---> Refer to the column names along with the data type while creating a table from the ER diagram.
---> If needed revisit the videos Week 2: Data Modeling and Architecture: Creating DDLs for Your Main Dataset and Normalized Datasets
---> While creating a table, make sure the column you assign as a primary key should uniquely identify each row.
---> If needed revisit the codes used to create tables for the gl_eats database. 
     This will help in getting a better understanding of table creation.*/
